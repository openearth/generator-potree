> Generator for potree websites

## Installation

This generator makes use of a few other software packages. So you ...
    have to install these first.

* node.js [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Then with node installed you should have the node package manager ...
    available. This provides you with the `npm` command.

With the npm command available you can install [Bower](http://bower.io), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [Babel](http://babeljs.io), and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-potree using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It's common practice to install everything as a user, not as root.

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-potree
```

The last command will work once we register this module at npm. For ...
    now and when developing you can use the source code version.

```bash
cd generator-potree
# install dependencies
npm install
npm link
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo potree
```

This should show an interactive screen (in the command line) where you can answer a few technical questions. The result should be a website generated in your directory. You can start a local test server. If you want to deploy to another website you can build a static website.

```bash
# local server
gulp serve
# build a static website
gulp build
```


## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He&#39;s a person with feelings and opinions, but he&#39;s very easy to work with. If you think he&#39;s too opinionated, he can be easily convinced. Feel free to [learn more about him](http://yeoman.io/).

## License

Generator is based on an example in [potree](https://github.com/potree/potree) and on the [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) generator.
